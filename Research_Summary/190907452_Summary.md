## Summary: Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated Learning



## Abstract

- Kay aspect of FL -> requirement of a centralized aggregator to store and update the global model

- reduced computational cost on blockchain -> decomposing the global parameter space into distinct chunks

## Introduction

- **Centralized aggregator Jobs**
  - Resposible for delinearing the global computational pricess into distinct rounds
  - maintains a global estimate of the ML model to update
  - Selecting devices and sending a copy of the global model estimate to each
  - performing crtical step of updating the global model 
- **Problems of centralized aggregator design**
  - logistical challenges
  - trust in centralized aggregator's selection and update mechanism
    - if centralized aggregator is biased -> global model is biased
  - single point of failure, robustness concern
  - typically cloud based, small orgnization might not be able to implement this
    - result, high barrier of entry for small organizations
- **If using blockchain to decentralize the process, need to carefully consider the computational constraints**
  - data storage in blockchain -> significant cost
  - pushing an entire machine learning model to blockchain becomes computationally bulky -> heavy latency
  - transaction size limitation
- **BAFFLE** 
  - SC maintain global model copy and associated computational state of the user
  - Lower computational cost
  - selection of end users in baffle is based on the worth of their local updates
  - no cloud base, easier to use

## Smart FL Contract Design: Decentralizing Role of Aggregator

- **Chunking**
  - block size limit 24k from user's version
